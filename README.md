# Power-BI
Comparative Analysis Dashboard:
It compares current and previous year sales and provides insights into YoY sales growth and budget variance. With a Power BI Tooltip, you can also view product-level sales comparison and month-wise budget variance. I even created a sales forecast! 

You can view the dashboard at https://lnkd.in/eXNeVgh6
